      When people think of Marvel movies, they usually think about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (unsurprising as it has now become the largest movie franchise ever and regularly dominates the international box office); however, the MCU does not account for all of the many Marvel movies that will release in the next few years. Some of the rights to Marvel movies still lie with Sony Pictures Entertainment, and while they have an ongoing relationship with Marvel and Disney at this point, it is unclear exactly how their movies will tie into the MCU. New Marvel updates on movies from both studios are revealed almost weekly though. Below is all the confirmed news on big-screen Marvel release dates.

      Critics have been voicing concerns about the MCU's long-term future plans. From the very first Iron Man, they questioned the longevity of franchises based on comic books, suggesting that superhero movies might simply be a passing fad. However, releases based on Marvel's comics show no signs of slowing down. While the pandemic caused several delays for Marvel and the MCU throughout 2020 and early 2021, they are now back at full force with 2022 being a heavy year for Marvel movies. Beyond the scheduled releases, there are further spin-offs, reboots, and many more sequels planned for the not-too-distant future. The San Diego Comic-Con International 2022 was a platform for a host of new info from Marvel and Disney, including clarity on release dates for movies like the MCU Blade reboot and Captain America: New World Order. They also revealed that after Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, the MCU Phase 5 officially begins. Kevin Feige has confirmed that the MCU is currently in The Multiverse Saga, with Kang the Conqueror as Phase 5's main antagonist.
